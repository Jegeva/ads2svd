          <p>Provides top level control of the system, including its memory system, at EL1 and EL0.</p>
        <p>This

       is part of the Other system control registers functional group.</p><h2>Configuration</h2><p>AArch64 System register SCTLR_EL1
                is architecturally mapped to
              AArch32 System register <a href="AArch32-sctlr.html">SCTLR</a>.

                Some or all RW fields of this register have defined reset values.
