<!-- This file describes the STM32F103xx SoC to the Arm Debugger.  The
     SoC provides a single Cortex-M3 core and a selection of peripherals
     (described in a TCF).

     The name of the file (excluding the extension) is a unique key used to
     identify this SoC by, the database uses this to locate SoC definitions.

     It is recommended that all files and directories in the SoCs folder are
     lower case.

     An example of this SoC being used by a platform can be found in
     Boards/beagleboard.org/OMAP_3530/project_types.xml -->

   <!-- The core element is used to collect together all of the core specific
        information for the debugger.  This information currently consists of
        details of the core, core registers, memory mapped registers and
        the devices view of the memory system.

        The following names the core 'Cortex-M3' and it is defined by the
        'Cortex-M3' register set. The name attribute will be referenced
        by an activity in the project_types.xml file (this is stored in a
        platform specific folder within the Boards folder) and the
        core_definition attribute matches the 'name' element of a core
        definition (an XML file in the Cores folder of the database)-->

   <core name="Cortex-M3" core_definition="Cortex-M3" >

      <!-- Memory mapped registers and memory maps are detailed in a TCF. The
           database uses the file name (excluding extension) to map a TCF to a
           core.  The board_id attribute must match the file name of a
           TCF contained in a SoCs folder or an immediate sub-folder (in this
           case SoCs/st). -->
