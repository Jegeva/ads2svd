<!-- This file describes the Xilinx Zynq-7000 SoC to the Arm Debugger.  The
     SoC provides two Cortex-A9 cores each with the same selection of
     peripherals (described in a TCF).  A pseudo-core is also provided for an
     SMP connection again with the same list of peripherals.

     It is not strictly necessary to define all three here but, it is provided
     as an example.


     The name of the file (excluding the extension) is a unique key used to
     identify this SoC by, the database uses this to locate SoC definitions.
     This should be lower case.  The name is used in a core element in an
     activity in the project_types.xml to link the activity to this SoC.

     An example of this SoC being used by a platform can be found in
     Boards/Xilinx/Zynq-7000_EK/project_types.xml -->

   <!-- The core element is used to collect together all of the core specific
        information for the debugger.  This information currently consists of
        details of the core, core registers, memory mapped registers and
        the devices view of the memory system.

        The following names the core 'Cortex-A9_0' and it is defined by the
        'Cortex-A9'. The name attribute will be referenced by an activity in
        the project_types.xml file (this is stored in a platform specific folder
        within the Boards folder) and the core_definition attribute matches the
        'name' element of a core definition (an XML file in the Cores folder of
        the database)-->
