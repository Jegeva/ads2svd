        The 'MemSpace' elements define the memory space mapping between Arm debugger and the model.
        A model can define a number of memory spaces, such as secure, non-secure and hypervisor.

        If models expose standard memory space names "NS Hyp", "Memory", "Secure" or "Normal"
        then Arm DS will automatically create a mapping between the Arm debugger memory space, and the
        same memory space as advertised by the model.

        If a model does not use standard memory space naming the maping can be overriden in the config
        file using the INSTANCE definition below, replacing the INSTANCE Name with the name of the core
        instance to associate the memory space id with

        <INSTANCE Name="coretile.core.cpu0">
            <MemSpace Type="Secure">0</MemSpace>
            <MemSpace Type="NonSecure">1</MemSpace>
            <MemSpace Type="Hypervisor">2</MemSpace>
        </INSTANCE>

        NOTE: Memory space overrides are not support for V8 Models. V8 Models MUST use standard
        memory space names -
        "NS Hyp", "Guest", "Secure Monitor", "Physical Memory (Secure)" or "Physical Memory (Non Secure)"
