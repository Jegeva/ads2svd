        DEVICE NUMBERS
        If <ConnectionID> tags are not specified, the device number must equal the CADI
        device ID, offset by one (for CADI device ID 14, use <DEVICE Number="15">).
        CADI device IDs can be obtained by invoking the FVP from the command line with \-\-list-instances

        If <ConnectionID> tags are specified, then the connection ID must match the CADI device target name,
        postfixed with a device index (two cores with a target name of ARM_Cortex-A9MP would be
        referenced as ARM_Cortex-A9MP_0 and ARM_Cortex-A9MP_1). Device numbers need not match the
        CADI device IDs, but must be sequential starting from 1

        In either case, the device numbers in the DTSL python script must match the device numbers
        in this file.

        The 'MemSpace' elements configure the default memory spaces.  A model
        can define a number of memory spaces as secure, non-secure and hypervisor. In
        most cases ARM models declare the following memory spaces.  Where ID 0 is
        secure, ID 1 is non-secure and ID 2 is hypervisor.  These can be overridden
        below.

        <DEVICE Number="3">
            <CP15ID>CustomCP15IDName</CP15ID>
            <MemSpace Type="Secure">0</MemSpace>
            <MemSpace Type="NonSecure">1</MemSpace>
            <MemSpace Type="Hypervisor">2</MemSpace>
        </DEVICE>

        <DEVICE Number="1">
            <ConnectionID>ARM_Cortex-A12_0</ConnectionID>
