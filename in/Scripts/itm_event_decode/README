This directory contains custom decoders for ITM software instrumentation trace.
You can add custom decoders here or in an itm_event_decode directory at the
same relative position in an extension configuration database.


A custom decoder

- has com.arm.debug.trace.events.itm.ITMCustomDecoder as a base class

- implements __init__(self, sink). The sink object is provided by Arm DS and has
  one method, accept(s).  The accept method takes a unicode string s as its
  argument.  Arm DS will emit a record containing the string s to the event
  view each time your decoder calls accept.

- implements the following callback methods for processing software 
  instrumentation packets and other events from Arm DS:

  notifyStart(self)
    indicates the start of trace.

  notifyEnd(self)
    indicates the end of trace.
  
  notifyByte(self, b)
    indicates a software instrumentation packet with a byte payload b.

  notifyShort(self, s)
    indicates a software instrumentation packet with a halfword payload s.

  notifyInt(self, i)
    indicates a software instrumentation packet with a word payload i.


Custom decoders will be found by Arm DS and used to populate the drop-down
Encoding list in the event settings dialog.  You can also name a custom decoder
in the DECODERS option of the trace report command.
